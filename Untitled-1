Diff is from baseline

configs/printing

    they are sending the html/css to the server with the resulted render, so with those thing, the server (iqpdf) generates a png image and they attach it to powerpoint.
        Gaston: probably headless rendering, or server rendering would be less expensive.
    visible icons
    detail for each node and level.
    amount of direct reports visible
    

changelog to each position.
bulk move to new supervisor

Manage delete requests

        ADMIN sees and has an alert if the position is on the baseline org.
            it would mean that someone gets fired.
    You can see a report of all the records that has been deleted.
